The urocc package provides the functionality of creating an animated ROC movie (ROCM), a universal ROC (UROC) curve and to compute the coefficient of predictive ability (CPA). These tools generalize the classical ROC curve and AUC and can be applied to assess the predictive abilities of features, markers and tests for not only binary classification problems but for just any ordinal or real-valued outcome.
