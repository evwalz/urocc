## ROCM in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)

Code to replicate the CPA plots for the numerical weather prediction example in the paper "Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) movies, universal ROC (UROC) curves, and coefficient of predictive ability (CPA)". 

### Data
HRES forecast and ERA reanalysis product downloaded from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) from https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/TIGGE and https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview at initial time 00:00 UTC for the years 2007-2018. Note that for precipitation summation over hourly rainfall from ERA5 is necessary. Both wind speed and 2m Temperature are instantaneous. 

### Processing the data
The data is stored in netCDF-format. Before computing the CPA plots the netCDF-files are modified by using CDO to perform standard operations on climate and forecast model data. After applying these operations (see tigge.sh) the data output is of the following form:
- regional data that covers Europe (25W, 44.5E, 74.5N, 25N)
- ranging from 2007-2018 (In Reanalysis also 27.12.2006-31.12.2006 included to compute persistence forecast)
- a single value of 2 meter temperature (wind speed, total precipitation) per day
- thus each file consists of 279 x 199 grid points and 365x9+366x3 = 4383 days

### Files
1. **RetrieveTiggeData.py**

download tigge data from ECMWF for 2m temperature, precipitation and wind speed for different lead times

2. **RetrieveERA5Data.py**

download ERA5 data from Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Climate Date Store for 2m temperature, precipitation and wind speed

2. **tigge.sh**:

performs CDO operations on tigge data set

3. **nwp_cpa_plot.py**:

uses preprocessed netCDF files to compute cpa plots.
